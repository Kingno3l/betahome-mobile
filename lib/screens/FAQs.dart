Plant One! Go-Green initiatives" that will be launched and aired on our online radio station, purchasing your furniture from BetaHome.ng automatically helps create awareness about deforestation and its impacts on the eco-system, how it affects our everyday lives as humans. Since 90% of the raw materials for our everyday household items, such as chairs, tables, beds, kitchen cabinets, and wardrobes, are provided by the woods and timber industry. For each BetaHome.ng product purchased, one percent of the proceeds are donated to a radio program that promotes ethical business practices in the wood and timber sector, effective reforestation mechanization, and training for local industry actors. Benefits to health for all parties involved, including local timber farmers who supply the raw materials and customers who buy BetaHome.ng furniture as a byproduct.\n\nTo be honest, finding a furniture store that accepts installment payments is difficult.\n"""),
